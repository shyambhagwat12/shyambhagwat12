### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Shyam. I work on different parts of the technology landscape and particularly interested in understanding patterns, problems, data and how to put them all together to solve real world challenges.

- ğŸŒ± I make a point to learn everyday. So learning is never ending.
- ğŸ’¡ Key ideas which inspire me - what problem the technology tries to solve, what are the assumptions and the subtleties involved.
